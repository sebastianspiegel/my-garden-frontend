# Story Peddler (frontend)

Frontend JS and styling for the My Garden application. To be used with https://github.com/sebastianspiegel/my-garden-backend. 

My Garden is an organizational application for amature gardeners. It was made for my mother, who wanted to be able to view all of the information on her seed packets at one time. 

This application was created as part of the software develpment course at Flatiron school. It was build using Ruby on Rails, React, and Redux. 

## Installation

After downloading backend and starting the server, navigate into the frontend repo and execute:
```npm start```
```npm install```

## Using the application

After registering, a user can add as many gardens as they like to their account. From the index page '/seeds', plants or 'seed packets' can be added to individual gardens. Name and phots are displayed on the front of the 'seed packets' (cards) and planting information is displayed on the back. 

## Development
